# REACT FLUID SCROLL

This creates a "virtual" scroll container around your content and uses a 3d transform to animate the content when a page is scrolled. This produces a much more fluid and controlled scrolling effect.

## Install

```
npm install https://github.com/Craigtut/react-fluid-scroll.git
```

or yarn...
